        "###The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (specific instances of that class). It defines a set of properties (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Object**: An instance of a class. Objects represent real-world entities and are created using the class definition. Each object can have unique values for the attributes defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation**: The concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is crucial for protecting the integrity of the object and hiding its internal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance**: The mechanism by which one class (child class) can inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism**: The ability of different objects to be accessed through the same interface, with each object responding to the method call in a way appropriate to its specific class. It allows methods to be defined in multiple forms, increasing flexibility and scalability in code.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts form the foundation of OOP, facilitating modularity, reusability, and the organized management of code.\n",
